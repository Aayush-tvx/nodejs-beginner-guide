# What is Node js 

Node JS is Server Side JavaScript 
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment that allows us to run JavaScript code on the server-side. It uses the V8 JavaScript engine, originally created for Google Chrome.
Node.js offers several key features that make it popular among developers. First, it's non-blocking and event-driven, which means it can handle multiple concurrent requests efficiently without blocking other operations.
Node.js is commonly used for building real-time applications like chat servers, collaborative tools, and streaming services. Its ability to handle a large number of simultaneous connections makes it ideal for such scenarios.
